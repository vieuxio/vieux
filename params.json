The amount of information that surfaces in a week is probably more than it did in a year, just 15 years ago. It seems that every other developer is introducing a new approach, and one has to spend hours after hours if they want to learn these in detail.\r\n\r\nSome ideas are new, but most of them are just a rebranding and mashup of old ideas. Of course, it is safe to claim that there is nothing really new under the sun. In fact, GUI programming is a field that’s being pursued for about 40 years. It would be naïve to say that an idea is brand new, in this sense.\r\n\r\nBut so here we are. I present you *Vieux*, a new approach to building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications. *Vieux* specializes not only in its gorgeous approach, but also its use of terminology. When designing *Vieux*, we got inspired by the things around us. Hopefully, you will feel at home with this down-to-earth, contextual naming convention.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe believe that software developers deserve better. So we are unveiling an architecture that we’ve been internally using for about 4 years. The best thing about *Vieux* is that it’s just a set of ideas that you can implement anywhere. Whether you are using Vanilla JS, Angular, React or any other framework, *Vieux* is easy to reason about, and easy to implement.\r\n\r\nWe believe that software developers deserve better. There is an ongoing debate about what MVC means, or what a Store is and how it should be implemented. Every framework and every developer has a different connotation for these keywords. So we wish to end the ambiguity once and for all.\r\n\r\n## Approach\r\n*Vieux* is based on a modular, componentized architecture. We believe that Single Responsibility is a great idea when it comes to building applications; so *Vieux* is against roles that span multiple responsibilities. This gives us the edge that every part of an app is self-evident.\r\n\r\n*Vieux* won’t keep you from introducing new roles to it, though. We know that every application is unique, and one could certainly need a different role than what are being currently offered in *Vieux*. So, *Vieux* is not a dogma, but a pointer in the direction of salvation. It’s a general frame that you can paint inside, to your heart’s content. As long as you don’t paint over the frame, the end result will satisfy you.\r\n\r\n## Structure\r\n*Vieux* offers 7 different roles to sketch your application in a 3-tier architecture. Five of the roles are at the core of *Vieux* and they are named *Culture*, *Representative*, *Regime*, *Undertaker* and *Stereotype*. The last two, *Diplomat* and *Satellite*, are auxiliary roles, from which more complex applications would benefit.\r\n\r\nApart from these roles, *Vieux* also makes use of a concept called Unions. Unions are a contextual group of roles, comprising of related *Culture*s, *Representative*s, *Regime*s, etc. Normally, Unions are contextual associations. They exist to imply a close collaboration within a group of roles. Unions are useful when drawing the big picture, dealing with folder and file organizations in an application and provide an easier mental model of your code structure.\r\n\r\n*Vieux* favors bureaucracy — half-duplex information flow, if you will—so the data flows only in one direction at any given time, as in the following example:\r\n\r\n![1 hsgphlgoodcoq9zqk4bl3g](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/698308/9088152/53c51914-3b97-11e5-9882-cbe14af9f6f1.png)\r\n\r\n## A simple overview\r\nIn the most abstract terms — that no one can get their heads around — every application models a state. In *Vieux*, *Regime*s are responsible for keeping the application state in memory, usually represented through *Stereotype*s. If necessary, they persist their state through stateless *Undertaker*s. For different persistence mechanisms, (eg. WebSQL, LocalStorage, AJAX or WebSockets) *Undertaker*s may use different *Satellite*s. *Culture*s are what the end-users are presented. They are stateless and as dummy as possible. Their state is kept and translated to the application state via *Representative*s. That is, *Culture*s inform *Representative*s when an update from the user is received; and *Representative*s process this update appropriately before transmitting it to a relevant *Regime*. An application consists of a number of *Regime*s, obviously, and their communications are carried out with *Diplomat*s.\r\n\r\n## Roles\r\n### Stereotype\r\nA *Stereotype* is an embodiment of a unique piece of information in your application. It might be a user, an account, a product, a shopping cart item, a credit card, or any unique embodiment that your application operates on. They hold a state in memory, and may include minor behaviors for manipulating some of their properties. *Regime*s are responsible for the creation and management of *Stereotype*s.\r\n\r\n### Culture\r\n*Culture* is a role that determines your user interface. It defines what your users see on the page. *Culture* includes a lot of predefined behaviors, like what happens when a user clicks on a button. *Culture*s are extremely dummy, in that they have no memory, or state, of their own. They know how to draw a user interface and how to handle user input; which they delegate to the *Representative*s.\r\n\r\n*Culture*s can contain other *Culture*s, in which case the children would be called sub*Culture*s. A list of clickable items in an application would be an instance of a *Culture* *List*, and individual items would each be instances of another *Culture* *ListItem*. Here, *List* has a number of *ListItem*s as its *subculture*s. Obviously, both *Culture*s have different behaviors and responsibilities. You see where we are getting at.\r\n\r\nEvery *Culture* has a *Representative* of its own. Some *Culture*s are broad and generic, while others present *Stereotype*s to the end user. In the above example, *Culture*s *List* and *ListItem* are responsible for presenting respective *Stereotype*s to the user.\r\n\r\n*Culture*s may welcome other, arbitrary *Culture*s as immigrant sub*Culture*s. These are commonly used as placeholders, as in modal presentations, whose content may vary greatly and therefore separated from a modal implementation.\r\n\r\n### Representative\r\nA *Representative* has two responsibilities. First, it keeps the state of its related *Culture*, and second, it is responsible for negotiating some of the behaviors of *Culture*s with respective *Regime*s. These negotiations may include transformations, filtering, or other means. If a *Stereotype* is involved in the *Culture* for a given *Representative*, the *Representative* is also responsible for keeping the *Stereotype*.\r\n\r\n### Regime\r\nA *Regime* is a stateful institution that deals with all the aspects of a specific purpose in an application. They breed, keep state of, and operate on *Stereotype*s. For complex task that would span different responsibilities, a *Regime* should negotiate with other *Regime*s, preferably over *Diplomat*s. Although they are responsible for keeping application state of a specific purpose, *Regime*s don’t necessarily involve in persisting that state. For persistence, *Regime*s should delegate to *Undertaker*s.\r\n\r\nIt’s worth mentioning that in very complex applications the developer may choose to implement two layers of *Regime*s on top of each other.\r\n\r\nUI Applications often need to keep a global state for application life cycle management. We recommend using a Global*Regime* for this purpose.\r\n\r\n### Undertaker\r\nAn *Undertaker* is responsible for persistence, serialization and deserialization of *Stereotype* instances. *Undertaker*s are completely stateless, and only deal with information passed onto them by *Regime*s. Normally, an *Undertaker* would use one specific technology for persistence, such as AJAX, WebSockets, or LocalStorage.\r\n\r\nIn some rare circumstances, the same data (or a variation of it) might need to be persisted to two different technologies. In this case, the developer may choose to delegate technology-specific persistence responsibilities to individual *Satellite*s.\r\n\r\n### Satellite\r\nA *Satellite* is a stateless role, whose purpose is to abstract away a certain persistence technology. *Satellite*s persist serialized data. Most applications work with a single technology, so *Satellite*s are mostly redundant.\r\n\r\n### Diplomat\r\n\r\nA *Diplomat*’s principal concern is to foster peaceful relations between *Regime*s. *Diplomat*s are quasi-autonomous in nature, in that they deal with *Regime*s, but are not owned by, or disposed by *Regime*s. They live as singletons, and are tasked with carrying out events to listeners. A *Regime* can choose to publish an event over a *Diplomat*, and other *Regime*s who are interested can receive the event and operate as a result.\r\n\r\nIn other circumstances that deal with UI state, reaching out to *Regime*s are unfavorable. When this is the case, *Representative*-level *Diplomat*s can also be used.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nThe ideas presented in *Vieux* are the pillars of a maintainable application architecture. It’s been used in huge JavaScript applications in production since 2011. We thought it would fade over with time, but to our surprise, the ideas in *Vieux* matured with every new framework since then.\r\n\r\nToday, *Vieux* is a suitable application architecture for nearly every major framework. In fact, we are hard at work with providing example implementations of *Vieux* on every framework we can get our hands on. *Vieux* is still very young, and we’re working hard on our GitHub organization to bring it up as an extensive resource for all your needs.\r\n\r\n*Vieux* has shed a pleasant light on our journeys in GUI programming for about 4 years. We believe it’s mature and battle-hardened enough to share it with the world, and we hope that it will also be a good companion for you.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n```\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Vieux\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
